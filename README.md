Front-end & Design Project
======================

## Project brief
Create a basic Image Gallery of your own design via HTML/CSS/JS. Find some sample images to use in your gallery in the "imgs" directory.

Please demonstrate knowledge of a JS framework of your choosing. We recommend using React or Angular.

Feel free to use NPM for any libraries available and make use of any ES6 features that are available. 

Below are the basic requirements for the gallery but feel free to go all out creating features if you like. Feel free to add any of your own images to the gallery as well.

## Requirements
1. Create a grid view displaying all images viewable in the gallery. 
2. Create a simple custom overlay for viewing a single gallery item. 
3. Clicking a gallery item should launch the overlay.
4. Include a way for the user to return to the grid view from the overlay.
5. Add a way for the user to navigate to the previous and next item in the grid from the overlay.
6. Add an animated transition between the grid view and overlay.
7. **Optional bonus task** Create some hover effect for the image thumbnails.
8. **Optional bonus task** Make it responsive using your best judgement.
9. **Optional bonus task** Host your solution. [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/) is free and easy to use option! 
10. **Optional bonus task** Add basic routing â€“ open the overlay based on URL.
11. **Optional bonus task** Use an free stock Image API for retrieving imagery for the gallery. [Pexels](https://www.pexels.com/api/) and [Unsplash](https://unsplash.com/developers) are great options.
